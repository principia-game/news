Earlier this year I created a new YouTube channel dedicated to Principia. The plan was to get some kind of new video content about Principia up and available on YouTube, but the channel ended up being dormant for some months.

This week I have begun to upload content to it! Currently the primary form of content on the channel are level showcase videos where I play through random interesting levels on the community site, right now mostly from the archive but there should be some newer levels that I'll play through soon.

I have also done some shorts that... vary in quality and seriousness. I'm sure there will be more experimental content for me to try in the future but otherwise you will hopefully see a lot of regular gameplay content going forward there.

Subscribing, liking but especially watching the videos in their entirely would help **a lot** with boosting the visibility of the YouTube channel. The strength of the game lies in the vast amount of user created levels, and showcasing all of this in an easily to digest form in the form of video content on YouTube will hopefully bring more attention to the game.
