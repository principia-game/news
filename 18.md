Hello everyone.

I am planning on making a new release soon, and would like help testing development builds of the game to make sure that things work the way they should.

At this point there is generally just one person working on the game, and that is me. There is only so much testing I can do. And the amount of testing during development that I get to hear about is close to zero, meaning either everything works as it should, or nobody is testing anything. Considering the issues with previous releases that I only got to know about after the fact, and the fact that certain platforms have remained broken in the master branch for weeks without anyone else noticing, it is most likely the latter.

So therefore I ask from every player who is interested to please test new development builds of the game and report issues that you discover, so they can be resolved before a new release is made.

## What's in the next release?
Usually the [Changelog](https://principia-web.se/wiki/Changelog) page on the wiki will contain a section at the very top for the future release, containing a preliminary list of changes that have happened in master since the last release. It gets updated occasionally during development but can lag behind a bit at times.

For a more raw log of what has changed you can see the [commit history](https://github.com/Bithack/principia/commits/master/) up to the commit for the last release.

## How do I obtain development versions?
For a long time we've had CI set up for the Principia source repository that will automatically build the game whenever changes are made. They then get available as artifacts that can be downloaded.

The [Nightly Builds](https://principia-web.se/wiki/Nightly_Builds) wiki page contains links for downloading the latest of such artifacts, which should correspond to the very latest development state of the game. Compiling the game from source is not necessary, though if you want to you [can of course do so](https://principia-web.se/wiki/Compiling_Principia).

Depending on your platform, you may be able to download a nightly build and run it alongside the latest stable. Even if development can be unstable at times, we strive to not mess with your user data, and you should be able to go back to the latest stable without compatibility issues.

## Reporting issues
The primary place to report bugs and other issues remains [the Principia issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/Bithack/principia/issues).

If you want to discuss the ongoing development of the game you are also free to come down to the #development channel in the [Principia Discord server](/discord) (also bridged to the [Principia Matrix space](/matrix)).

Thanks for your support!
